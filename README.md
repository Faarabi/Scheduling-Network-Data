# scheduling-degradation
This repository contains a simulated data set for a network of jobs with degradation rate. This data is include the cordinates of 200 jobs and the fixed processing time and degradation rate related to each job. To find the distance between any two specific jobs, we have made a network of nodes (each job is a node) and find the distances between any two of them by using euclidean distances.
